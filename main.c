 * This is a HTTP server.  It accepts connections on port 8080, and
 * serves a local static document.
 *
 * The clients you can use are 
 * - httperf (e.g., httperf --port=8080),
 * - wget (e.g. wget localhost:8080 /), 
 * - or even your browser.  
 *
 * To measure the efficiency and concurrency of your server, use
 * httperf and explore its options using the manual pages (man
 * httperf) to see the maximum number of connections per second you
 * can maintain over, for example, a 10 second period.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * # make test1
 * # make test2
